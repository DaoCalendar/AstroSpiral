## AstroSpiral

The Astro Spiral project presents an innovative way to compare astronomical images of the sky by building a convex spiral (modification of the Graham Scan algorithm for convex hull) according to the bright objects in a photo. On that purpose, I made an application for Windows and Mac OS X, written in C++ that uses the Cinder toolbox.

### Introduction

How do astronomers find near-Earth asteroids (NEAs)? 

Below, you can see a background of "motionless" stars, which are too far from us to observe a difference in position. The asteroid BJ19377, on the other hand, is close enough, so we can see it moving in the sky.
