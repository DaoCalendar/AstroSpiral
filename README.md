## AstroSpiral

The Astro Spiral project presents an innovative way to compare astronomical images of the sky by building a convex spiral (using a modification of the Graham Scan algorithm for convex hull) according to the bright objects in a photo. On that purpose, an application for Windows and Mac OS X, written in C++, is developed using the Cinder toolbox.

### Introduction

How do astronomers find near-Earth asteroids (NEAs)? 

In the night sky, we can see stars shining with their own light - but how do we know they are actually stars? While all sky objects appear bright, some stars and galaxies radiate light, as opposed to the Moon, planets, natural satellites, comets, and near-Earth asteroids, which reflect light. How can we distinguish the two types of objects? 

Below, you can see a background of "motionless" stars, which are too far from us to observe a difference in position. The asteroid BJ19377, on the other hand, is close enough, so we can see it moving in the sky.
